Hey Nothing Community! 👋

We've created a Glyph Toy inspired by **Twin Peaks** - the cult TV series by David Lynch. 

## What it does:

Two animated patterns that you can switch with a **long press**:

🔺 **Zigzag Pattern** - The iconic Red Room floor with animated chevrons flowing upward across the entire 25x25 matrix

🦉 **Owl Symbol Glitch** - Three connected diamonds flickering with a glitchy effect, mimicking an unstable electrical connection. Uses full brightness gradients (0-2047 levels) for realistic flickering!

## Features:
- Single toy package with two patterns
- Switch between them using Long Press
- Smooth animations optimized for Phone (3)
- Clean, production-ready code
- 0 dependencies except GlyphMatrix SDK

## For Fans:
If you've watched Twin Peaks, you'll immediately recognize the Red Room floor pattern and the mysterious owl symbol. If you haven't... well, it's just a damn fine glyph that does absolutely nothing useful 😄☕

## Technical Details:
- Written in Kotlin
- Uses brightness gradients for realistic glitch effect
- Two animation modes in one service
- Source code available on GitHub

## Download:
