Twin Peaks Glyph Toy for NOTHING Phone 3
====================

About the Project
--------------
This Glyph Matrix toy contains two animated patterns inspired by Twin Peaks, switchable with a long press:

1. **Zigzag Pattern** - The iconic Red Room floor pattern with animated zigzag chevrons continuously flowing upward across the 25x25 LED matrix.

2. **Owl Symbol Glitch** - Twin Peaks owl symbol with glitchy flicker effect, mimicking an unstable electrical connection. The pattern randomly flickers on and off like the eerie lights in the Red Room.

**Features:**
- Two distinct visual animations in one toy
- Switch between patterns using long-press on Glyph Button
- Smooth animations optimized for Nothing Phone (3) Glyph Matrix
- Pure visual experience - no user interaction required

After going through the `Setup` stage in this document, the project can be run on your Nothing device.

The project already contains the necessary libraries (GlyphMatrix SDK) and clean production-ready code structure. For SDK documentation, please reference the [**GlyphMatrix Development Kit**](https://github.com/KenFeng04/GlyphMatrix-Development-Kit).

This project is written in Kotlin and utilizes a useful Kotlin wrapper `GlyphMatrixService.kt`, which wraps around the original SDK.

Requirements
--------------
Android Studio, Kotlin, compatible device with Glyph Matrix

Setup
-----------------------
**1.** Prepare your Nothing device and connect it to the computer for development

**2.** Clone this project or download this repository as a ZIP and uncompress it to your local directory.

**3.** Open a new windows in Android studio and hit file on the menu bar, select open.

**4.** Select the directory where you have cloned the repository or the unzipped folder and click `Open`

**5.** Once the Gradle files have been synced and your phone is connected properly, you should see your device name shown at the top and a play button. Click the play button to install this example project.

Running the Glyph Toy
------------
When the project is installed on your Nothing device, the Twin Peaks toy needs to be activated before it can be used.

**1.** Open the `Glyph Interface` from your device settings.

**2.** Tap on the first button on the right menu to access toy management.

**3.** Use the handle bars to drag a toy from `Disabled` to `Active` state.
